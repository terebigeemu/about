## FAQ

#### Why is it called BrowserKnight?

If you haven't checked out the BrowserQuest project by Mozilla and Little Workshop, you should! It basically encompasses the idea that you can make fun games using web technologies, such as HTML5 and WebGL. Originally I was going to use Unity but I felt due to it's proprietary and commercial nature, I was much better finding other solutions, such as Phaser. Hollow Knight is a game made down in South Australia which I also quite admire, and will definietly be taking inspiration from in terms of control style, even though I haven't played it :) I also felt that it has a good roll off the tongue, especially of games such as BrowserQuest and AdventureQuest Worlds having interestingly similar names.

#### What was your main inspiration for BrowserKnight?

Watching 4 console, 8 player Super Smash Bros was the 'light bulb' moment for the game. It brought me back to the time we had 12 friends play Quizlet Live at a restaurant dinner. It would be awesome if I could make my own multiplayer game that didn't have technical limitations. Games such as Minetest which run on low-end hardware and only being 30mb are amazing to me, and I wanted to bypass a technical limitation with BrowserQuest so that anyone with a phone and an Internet connection could play. I've never read Homestuck but I have a feeling both will have a lot in common.

#### How are you going to make BrowserKnight?

I honestly don't really know. I don't even know how I'm going to make the art or the music for the game. 8-bit art may be an option but I don't feel it would be the best fit for the game. I also really liked the music from Undertale but similarly, I'm not sure quite how I'm going to achieve it. I am considering crowdsourcing, so if you would like to contribute, please contact me!

#### Have you started development yet?

Most of my projects go into development hell, and consider today the start date of development.

#### Where can I keep updated with BrowserKnight?

For the time being this GitHub organisation is the best way to keep updated with BrowserKnight. I'll update this page accordingly if I ever decide to make a Twitter or a Reddit, for example.
